How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation and service workers are related as at first we are making everything so that it works under ideal conditions. After that we account for the scenario where the internet connection might not be available and making our app work offline as well. We used service workers as a way to keep our website running even when we did not have ideal conditions after having implemented our main website already. In the expose part we first had to make the website and then after that we used the service workers to have it available offline and also as a web application.
